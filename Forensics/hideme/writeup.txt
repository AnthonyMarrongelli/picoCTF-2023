Description
Every file gets a flag.
The SOC analyst saw one image been sent back and forth between two people.
They decided to investigate and found out that there was more than what meets the eye here.

To find this flag, I first used exiftool on the png to see if it had any hidden metadata that we could use.
I didn't really see anything out of the ordinary.
So I then used binwalk to see if anything was hidden inside the png.
There I found that there was a 'secret/flag.png' hidden inside the png.
I used binwalk to extract it, and sure thing the png that was hidden inside had the flag inside of it.

flag: picoCTF{Hiddinng_An_imag3_within_@n_ima9e_82101824}
