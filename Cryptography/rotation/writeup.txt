You will find the flag after decrypting this file
Download the encrypted flag here.

So for this flag, the name is rotation so I'm going to assume that this has some sort of ROT cipher used to encrypt the data.
Using a rot cipher decrypter, I was able to find that after 8 rotations we recieve the flag.

flag: picoCTF{r0tat1on_d3crypt3d_949af1a1}
