To solve this flag, we are given a jpg file.
We are told to find the flag.

First thing to do was look at the jpeg, where we see an atbash cipher.
Not knowing what we were supposed to decrypt.
I figured something was hidden in the jpg.
So I used steghide to extract whatever was in there, with no passphrase.
And it worked and yielded the flag with atbash encryption.
After decrypting I got the flag.

flag: picoCTF{atbash_crack_8a0feddc}
