Description
How about we take you on an adventure on exploring certificate signing requests
Take a look at this CSR file here.

For this flag, I downloaded the CSR file and then used "file readmycert.csr".
That showed me that it was a PEM certificate request.
Using that knowledge I googled what a PEM certificate request was.
And I found a "decoder" for such.
Pasting the text inside the csr into the decoder gave me the flag.

flag: picoCTF{read_mycert_693f7c03}
