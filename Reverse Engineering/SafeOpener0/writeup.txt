Description
What can you do with this file?
I forgot the key to my safe but this file is supposed to help me with retrieving the lost key. Can you help me unlock my safe?

To solve this flag, I simply downloaded the file and opened it in VScode.
My VSCode offered to decompile the java class file for me, in which I was able to grab the flag from one of the functions inside the class file.
