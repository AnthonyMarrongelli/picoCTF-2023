Description
Try reversing this file? Can ya?
I forgot the password to this file. Please find it for me?

To find this flag, I inspected the file that was given to us.
It was a dynamically linked ELF file that was not stripped.
Knowing that, I loaded up ghidra and decompiled the file.
After looking at the main function I was able to decipher the flag as it was in the code.

flag: picoCTF{3lf_r3v3r5ing_succe55ful_fa9cb3b1}
