Description
Can you make a CoreWars warrior that always loses, no ties?
Your opponent is the Imp. The source is available here. 

For this flag, we are given a "imp.red" file that stores some ascii text.
The text I was able to alter to make it so the "imp" wouldn't move.
This made his lose 100% of the time and yielded the flag.
