Get the flag and reach the exit.
Welcome to BabyGame! Navigate around the map and see what you can find! The game is available to download here.

For this flag I started the instance and began messing around.
I found that I could move my character by using "w", "a", "s", and "d".
I also found that "p" moves me to the X, where I "win".
But I needed to find the flag.
After testing every spot and trying to see If I could break boundaries.
I found the flag outside of the first row on the left.
It displayed "Player has flag: 64".
And from there I clicked "p" and was moved to the end.
Where I won and was given the flag.
